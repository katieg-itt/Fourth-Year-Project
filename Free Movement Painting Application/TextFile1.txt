What was done tonight:

The main difficulty that I faced is it was not possible to segment a TrailRenderer, what this means is that I could not start and stop drawing a line. 
I got around this by using the LineRenderer gameObject. I immediatly encountered an issue where a single GameObject could not contain multiple LineRenderers,
this issue was solved by keeping a list of GameObjects, each containing a LineRenderer. As lines are permanent and there is no way to erase lines in my 
application, I only ever need to use the top item in the List.

While I was in the process of doing this, I also extracted some of the blocks of code, such as tracking the movement or the colour sphere hit detection 
to their own methods in order to increase code readability.
